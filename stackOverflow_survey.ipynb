    "## Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "December 2011 Stack Overflow launched their first Annual User Survey to measure changes in user demographics and trends from the previous year. Stack Overflow have continued to reach out to the developer community to ask them a variety of questions, everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. The survey results are published and are available to view here: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey and includes questions with numerical answers (e.g. age, salary) and questions with categorical answers from multiple choice options ( \"choose one\" or \"choose all that apply\" ). \n",
    "\n",
    "In February 2020, almost 65,000 responses were collected from over 180 countries and dependent territories.  The survey asked respondents 61 questions (i.e., variables), including two questions regarding what programming languages users have done extensive development work in over the past year, and which languages they want to work in over the next year.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to explore the data provided by Stack Overflows' developer community; analyse correlations between programming languages and between other frameworks, libraries, and tools (i.e., other technologies) users have done extensive development work in over the past year."
