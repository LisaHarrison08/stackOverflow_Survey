December 2011 Stack Overflow launched their Annual User Survey to measure changes in user demographics and trends from the previous year. Stack Overflow have continued to reach out to the developer community to ask them a variety of questions, everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. The survey results are published and are available to view here: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

- What is the most widely used programming language?
- How frequently do you learn a new language or framework?
